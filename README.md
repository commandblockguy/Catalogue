# Catalogue
A catalogue plugin for https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chestshop-for-iconomy-recreation.9376/

Currently in development - view details here: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=258413#258413

Not currently intended for actual use as it requires a MySQL server to use

To use:
Create a sign shop, or make a transaction with an existing one.
You can view shops selling a certain item with /catalogue (item)

Prerequisites:
	Bukkit
	A MySQL server (Trying to find a better system)
	ChestShop (see link above)
	Towny (Trying to make this optional)
